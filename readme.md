### Request for MacBook Sponsorship

I urgently need a sponsor to provide a MacBook with an ARM processor, or a donation to purchase one. This would enable full compatibility between the NekoRay/NekoBox software and this processor, which is not yet possible.

Sponsorship would empower rapid deployment of this software for macOS users.

Please [contact me](mailto:naqdi.ab@gmail.com)
