### Sponsorship Opportunity: Building NekoRay/NekoBox for macOS

I am seeking a sponsor that provides access to GitHub Enterprise services and ARM-based runners to assist with building and deploying the NekoRay/NekoBox software for macOS. 

As outlined in [GitHub's documentation](https://github.blog/2023-10-02-introducing-the-new-apple-silicon-powered-m1-macos-larger-runner-for-github-actions/), each GitHub Actions job on macOS may incur significant costs. I estimate each build would require 5-10 minutes on an ARM-based runner, with costs likely exceeding $1 per run. 

A sponsorship would empower faster iteration and deployment of this software for the macOS community.

Please [contact me](mailto:naqdi.ab@gmail.com) if interested in this sponsorship opportunity (or please donate).
